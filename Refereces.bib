@article{Mishura2008,
abstract = {The paper focuses on discrete-type approximations of solutions to non-homogeneous stochastic differential equations (SDEs) involving fractional Brownian motion (fBm). We prove that the rate of convergence for Euler approximations of solutions of pathwise SDEs driven by fBm with Hurst index H1/2 can be estimated by [image omitted], where is the diameter of partition used for discretization. For discrete-time approximations of Skorohod-type quasilinear equation driven by fBm we prove that the rate of convergence is [image omitted] .},

@article{Cai2009,
abstract = {An HIV/AIDS epidemic model with treatment is investigated. The model allows for some infected individuals to move from the symptomatic phase to the asymptomatic phase by all sorts of treatment methods. We first establish the ODE treatment model with two infective stages. Mathematical analyses establish that the global dynamics of the spread of the HIV infectious disease are completely determined by the basic reproduction number ℜ0. If ℜ0≤1, the disease-free equilibrium is globally stable, whereas the unique infected equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable if ℜ0{\textgreater}1. Then, we introduce a discrete time delay to the model to describe the time from the start of treatment in the symptomatic stage until treatment effects become visible. The effect of the time delay on the stability of the endemically infected equilibrium is investigated. Moreover, the delay model exhibits Hopf bifurcations by using the delay as a bifurcation parameter. Finally, numerical simulations are presented to illustrate the results.},
